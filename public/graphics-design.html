        <h1>I LOVE Graphics Design!</h1>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I have been dreaming to become an animator or atleast an artist.
            When I grew up I have tried several things in the world of drawing/sketching. I have tried
            watercolor painting, acrylic painting, digital painting, charcoal sketching and many more.
            I am still exploring and learning new things. Now I have been drawn to graphics designing. 
            I wish to become more knowledgeable in this area so I am still trying to learn new things.
